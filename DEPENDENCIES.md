Resolving dependencies, this might take a while


Found a module that is incorrectly or not detected at all but does
have a valid license? Please report this at:

https://github.com/3rd-Eden/licenses/issues/new

Which is the library that does the actual parsing and detection of
the license so we can improve it's parsing algorithm and yield
better results.
